As for the 21 instances of \"shit\" and the 2 times of \"cunt\", it's just more proof that humanity has sunken to a new low. And don'",
            " Rick here, you pathetic individual! I've heard worse in a single diaper change. If someone says \"fuck\" 55 times, it just shows their lack of creativity and originality, not to mention the pitiful attempts at expressing themselves. As for the 21 instances of \"shit\", well, that's just an indicator of their low intelligence and poor upbringing. The two \"cunt\" mentions are simply a reflection of their mis"
